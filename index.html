                <h2> Ways of Universal Design </h2> <br>
                <h3> Mobile First Design </h3>
                <p> By designing for mobile devices, which have smaller screens and limited capabilities compared to desktops you are able to support functionality for a large number of users. A mobile-first approach forces you to prioritize essential elements and ensures a clean, responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Mobile-first is also beneficial for users who rely on voice commands or assistive touch technologies. </p> <br>
                <h3> Semantic HTML </h3>
                <p> Using correct HTML tags such as header, nav, footer help screen readers. Using the alt tag to describe images in a descriptive manner can help those visually impaired. Headings h1, h2, and h3 should be in a logical structure. </p> <br>
                <h3> Keyboard Accessibility </h3>
                <p> Ensure all interactive elements on the page such as links and nav items can be navigated and activated. </p> <br>
                <h3> Persona </h3>
                <p> Create a persona and develop a description of your users and what they wish to accomplish by using your product. Doing so will help imagine the struggles and allow design for specific needs of users. </p>

                <h2> 7 Principles by North Carolina State University's Center for Universal Design</h2> <br>
                <h3> Equitable Use </h3>
                <p> Design for ALL users and keep in mind users with varying types of disabilities </p> <br>
                <h3> Flexibility in Use </h3>
                <p> Allow the user to choose how they would like to use the product. This principle encourages flexibility and adaptable design so the user feels more free and they are able to make their own choices. An example of this is letting the user customize their own profile. </p> <br>
                <h3> Simple and Intuitive Use </h3>
                <p> The usage of the design should be easy to grasp regardless of a user's experience, knowledge or any skills, and the aim is to reduce complexity overall. A way of doing this is using indicators or icons to match up with what the design is meant to do, for example a submit button could be green. </p> <br>
                <h3> Perceptible Information </h3>
                <p> The design conveys information to the user despite any disabilities such as vision or hearing impairments. </p> <br>
                <h3> Tolerance for Error </h3>
                <p> Error is kept to a minimum by designing in anticipation of any actions the user may commit which can result in an error. </p> <br>
                <h3> Low Physical Effort </h3>
                <p> The design should be able to be used without much physical effort from the user. An example of this would be if a button on the website was hard to click on a mobile device.</p> <br>
                <h3> Size and Space for Approach and Use </h3>
                <p> Appropriate size and space involved with the design. A example for a way of implementing this would be by creating thumbable links on mobile devices to be easily clicked.</p>

                <h2> Tools to Use </h2> <br>
                <h3> HTML Validator </h3>
                <p> The tool created by W3c allows you to paste a website code or file into their website in order to check whether there are any issues pertaining to design. </p> <br>
                <h3> WAVE </h3>
                <p> WAVE is a tool that checks for any errors such as contrast, structure, ARIA and more. They have a extension or you can simply enter the website URL into their website. </p> <br>
                <h3> Adobe Color </h3>
                <p> Using Adobe's website which allows you to find color codes you can also compare and check the contrast ratio of two colors to see whether the contrast is good enough. A contrast ratio of over 5 is usually enouguh for readability. </p>
